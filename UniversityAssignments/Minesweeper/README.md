Final project from ANSI C course. I didn't want to make another text based app so I got permission to use SDL2 library.  
Game parameters are still controled from program arguments or console input but main game is finally ^^ graphical.  

SDL2 was used for:
 - window creation
 - graphical context, rendering & drawing
 - keyboard/mouse input
